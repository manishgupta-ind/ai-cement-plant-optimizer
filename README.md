# **AI-Powered Cement Plant Optimizer**

This project presents an end-to-end solution for optimizing a cement manufacturing plant using a series of machine learning models and a user-friendly frontend interface. The goal is to provide plant operators with real-time insights and prescriptive recommendations to improve key performance indicators (KPIs) related to quality, energy efficiency, and sustainability.

## **Solution Architecture**

The solution is composed of three main parts:

1. **Machine Learning Models:** Seven distinct models are used to predict critical KPIs across the plant's three main processes: Blending, Pyroprocessing, and Grinding. These models would be trained on historical plant data and deployed to a platform like Google Cloud's Vertex AI.  
2. **Backend API:** A backend service (e.g., a Google Cloud Function or Flask app) acts as a bridge between the frontend and the deployed models. It receives input variables from the user, sends them to the appropriate model endpoint, and returns the predictions.  
3. **Frontend Interface:** A web-based application (built with React) provides an interactive dashboard where users can adjust input variables, view real-time predictions, and receive generative AI-powered recommendations for improving plant operations.
